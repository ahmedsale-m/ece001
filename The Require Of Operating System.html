 <p><h2>The Require Of Operating System:</h2></p>
            <p><big>Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with purchased computers (OEM-installation), whereas others may run directly from media (i.e. live cd) or flash memory (i.e. USB stick).Types of operating systems
                Single-tasking and multi-tasking
                A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running in concurrency. 
                This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes.
                 These processes are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. 
                 In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to each of the programs. 
                 Unix-like operating systems, such as Solaris and Linux—as well as non-Unix-like, such as AmigaOS—support preemptive multitasking. 
                 Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 
                 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking; 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x used preemptive multi-tasking.

                        <p><big>Single-user operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem.[8] A multi-user operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, 
                            such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time.
                             Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources to multiple users.</big></p></li>
                             <li><p><h3>Distributed:</h3>
                            <p>A distributed operating system manages a group of distinct, networked computers and makes them appear to be a single computer,
                                 as all computations are distributed (divided amongst the constituent computers) </p> </p></li>
                                 <li><p><h3>Templated:</h3>
                                <p><big>In the distributed and cloud computing context of an OS, templating refers to creating a single virtual machine image as a guest operating system, then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines. 
                                    The technique is used both in virtualization and cloud computing management, and is common in large server warehouses.</big></p></p></li>
                                    <li><p><h3>Library:</h3>
                                    <p><big>A library operating system is one in which the services that a typical operating system provides, such as networking, 
                                        are provided in the form of libraries and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel:
                                         a specialized, single address space, machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments.
                                         Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator. 
                                         Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s, such as resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processing.
                                          Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960s.[11] Hardware features were added,
                                           that enabled use of runtime libraries, interrupts, and parallel processing. When personal computers became popular in the 1980s, operating systems were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers. </big></p> </p></li></ul>
